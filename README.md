## 🧠 How It Works

Litogen Lite uses a client-side pipeline:

1. Image is processed in the browser  
2. Height map is generated based on brightness  
3. Geometry is built for the selected shape  
4. STL is generated using a Web Worker  
5. File is downloaded directly to your device  

No server, no API, no tracking.
